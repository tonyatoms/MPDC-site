The  McKinley Park Development Council (MPDC) is a new (Summer of 2017) neighborhood organization which does not just look forward to helping build an even better neighborhood, but we've already got some great stuff done. 

We aim to include a FAQ on this page in the very near future. If you have specific questions, feel free to let us know via the contact form.

Thanks for reading and caring about our neighborhood!
