Join us for our next public meeting at </br>The McKinley Park Fieldhouse </br>Wednesday, February 21, 2018 
</br>7pm - 8:30pm. 

With community input, the MPDC along with CMAP are creating a neighborhood plan for McKinley Park. Join us at our next monthly meeting where we 
will discuss the process of making the plan with a representative from CMAP, the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning. We'll also hear updates from each of the committees doing the work of the MPDC.

We thank our host, The Chicago Park District!

We hope you can join us!
