Please join us on Monday December 18, 2017
</br>6:30 - 8 pm 
</br>at One City Tap (3115 S Archer)

We have lots of reasons to celebrate: The holiday season, our founding year, the grant we recently received from Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning (CMAP) to create a Neighborhood Plan for McKinley Park, and you, our excellent neighbors!

We look forward to a 2018 full of McKinley Park Activity: We are opening up our membership to the entire community, starting with our first meeting January 17 (mark your calendars!); and we will be actively fundraising and convening participants for the Community Planning process in early 2018.  

But first, letâ€™s celebrate! Join us at One City Tap: We'll have pizza, and One City Tap is running a special with $4.50 craft beer drafts all night. 

We hope you can join us! Please let us know at <a href="mailto:mckinleyparkdevelopmentcouncil@gmail.com?Subject=OneCity%20RSVP" target="_top"> mckinleyparkdevelopmentcouncil@gmail.com</a> if you are planning to come so we can plan accordingly.
