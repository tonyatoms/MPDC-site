# MPDC-site
A website for the McKinley Park Development Council community organization.

The site is generated with the Hugo static web site generator and uses the Future Imperfect theme: https://github.com/jpescador/hugo-future-imperfect. We had the honor and pleasure of being the first site to use the theme for > 2 languages and helped test an experimental code branch that supported multi-langage display.

See the Hugo Documentation at https://gohugo.io/documentation/ for implementation details.
